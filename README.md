Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them Into a Program

Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective rather than jumping straight into technical solutions. In CS 250, this was accomplished through the use of user stories, which helped translate high-level requirements into clear, actionable development tasks. User stories focus on who the user is, what they need, and why they need it, which keeps development aligned with real-world expectations. By breaking requirements into smaller, testable stories with acceptance criteria, I was able to ensure that each feature delivered value and met stakeholder expectations before moving on to the next increment.

My Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes I Will Use in the Future

I approach program development as an iterative and collaborative process, rather than a linear one. Agile practices such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews helped me stay adaptable and focused on delivering working software in short cycles. In the future, I plan to continue using Scrum-based Agile processes, particularly sprint planning, user stories, and retrospectives. These practices encourage continuous improvement, early feedback, and flexibility when requirements change, which are critical in real-world software development environments.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development

Being a good team member in software development means more than completing assigned tasks—it requires communication, accountability, and collaboration. Throughout this course, I learned the importance of supporting other team roles, being open to feedback, and contributing to shared goals. A strong team member communicates progress clearly, raises concerns early, respects different perspectives, and works toward delivering quality software rather than focusing only on individual contributions. Agile development reinforced that successful projects depend on teamwork, transparency, and continuous learning.
